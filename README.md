# django-svelte-jsoneditor

A JSONField for django allowing manipulation and display of json data.

The field is built using Jos deJong's new [svelte-jsoneditor](https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor).

## About Svelte

You don't need to know or care. It's the JavaScript framework used to develop the widget - but the widget JS is all pre-built so there are no extra requirements.

## Background

This is a replacement for `django-jsoneditor` (which uses the older `jsoneditor` - you can [see the differences here](https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor#differences-between-josdejongsvelte-jsoneditor-and-josdejongjsoneditor).

You can [read about why we're not simply updating `django-jsoneditor` here](https://github.com/nnseva/django-jsoneditor/issues/71
